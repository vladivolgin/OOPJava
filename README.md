# First solution :
Development of console java applications 
Main goal of this work is to develop a console application to implement the simplest application using arrays, strings and files.
The main task is to find and print how many times each word is repeated in the text.

# Second solution:
String processing. Using regular expressions in java applications.
Main goal of this work is to implement a console application that allows you to manipulate a string by splitting it into elements using regular expressions.
The main task is to write a regular expression that determines if the given string is a valid MAC address.
– an example of correct expressions: aE:dC:cA:56:76:54.
– an example of incorrect expressions: 01:23:45:67:89:Az.

# Third solution: 
Java collections.

Main goal of this work is using collections developing java applications.

The main task:  The lists (stacks) I(1..N) and U(1..N) contain the results of N measurements of current and voltage at an unknown resistance R. Find the approximate number R by the least squares method.
